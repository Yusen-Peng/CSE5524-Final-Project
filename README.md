# No initial Bounding Box is Needed: A Feature Extraction Driven Approach for Object Tracking 

## CSE5524 Final Project - Yuhan Duan, Cen Gu, Yusen Peng

Many existing object tracking methods require initital bounding boxes for object tracking. In our work, we propose an approach that automatically detects interest points using interest point detectors on the first frame image, performs segmentation techniques upon these detected interest points, and finally generate our own bounding boxes without relying on provided ones. Eventually, we perform multiple tracking techniques to track objects in the dataset.
